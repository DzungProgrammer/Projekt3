		 Hello world, Another day you turn Another day will come what may The eye of a needle A pin head they say One soul dies One
		soul takes life Searching forever What’s wrong and what’s right Does it matter What they see in their eyes Does it matter
		What they never learn Still world you turn, Still world You will hear babies cry Stars in the heavens Will light up your
		night The moon will ever Keep glowing bright And it won’t matter at all If it’s wrong or right, Under the presence of your
		keeping We will live out our whole lives Haunted still Worried the right Tomorrow another Tear will fall Another child born
		Despite it all And if not now Nothing have we learned Worry not my world For still you turn.
